# CSS

help.unhcr.org uses compass to compile `scss` files into the `style.css` file.

Follow these [instructions](http://compass-style.org/install/) to install compass on your machine.

Once you have compass installed on your computer you can now compile the scss files into the `style.css` folder. To do this you must first `cd` into `wp-content/themes/help` folder. Then run the command `compass compile`. To have compass watch for any changes you make to the file, use `compass watch`.

The main file to edit is `style.scss` found in `wp-content/themes/help`.
