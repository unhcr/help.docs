# Docs

The docs are built on [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

To build the docs simply run:

`curl -X POST http://readthedocs.org/build/helpdocs`

In general though, the UNHCR github account is setup with a webhook so that when you push to github it builds the docs automatically.
